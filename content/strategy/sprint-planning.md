# Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is the foundation of our agile development process. This meeting sets the direction for the upcoming sprint and ensures alignment between the team and stakeholders.

## Sprint Structure

We operate on 2-week sprints that run from Monday to Friday:

- **Sprint 1**: Week 1 Monday - Week 1 Friday
- **Sprint 2**: Week 2 Monday - Week 2 Friday

This structure provides:

- Consistent planning and review cycles
- Clear boundaries for work commitment
- Regular opportunities for feedback and adjustment

## Sprint Planning Meeting

### Duration and Attendance

- **Time**: 2 hours maximum
- **Attendees**: Development team, Product Owner, Scrum Master
- **Optional**: Stakeholders for clarification

### Agenda

#### 1. Sprint Goal Discussion (30 minutes)

- Review product vision and roadmap
- Discuss sprint objectives
- Align on priorities and business value

#### 2. Capacity Assessment (30 minutes)

- Team availability and time off
- Historical velocity analysis
- Capacity calculation for sprint

#### 3. Backlog Refinement (45 minutes)

- Review and prioritize user stories
- Break down large stories into smaller tasks
- Estimate effort using story points

#### 4. Sprint Backlog Commitment (15 minutes)

- Final selection of work items
- Team commitment to sprint goal
- Identification of sprint risks

## Capacity Planning

### Team Capacity Calculation

```
Sprint Capacity = Team Size × Sprint Days × Focus Factor
```

**Factors considered:**

- Team size (developers, QA, designers)
- Sprint duration (10 working days)
- Focus factor (0.6-0.8 for meetings, support, etc.)
- Individual availability (vacation, training)

### Velocity Tracking

We track velocity to improve planning accuracy:

- **Historical Velocity**: Average points completed over last 3 sprints
- **Capacity vs Velocity**: Adjust estimates based on actual delivery
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor for improvements or blockers

## Story Point Estimation

### Fibonacci Scale

We use modified Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40

### Estimation Guidelines

- **1 point**: Simple task, 1-2 hours
- **2 points**: Straightforward feature, few hours
- **3 points**: Moderate complexity, half day
- **5 points**: Full day of work
- **8+ points**: Complex features requiring breakdown

### Planning Poker

- Each team member estimates independently
- Discussion of estimates and assumptions
- Re-estimate until consensus
- Use reference stories for consistency

## Sprint Backlog Creation

### Acceptance Criteria

Each story must have:

- Clear definition of done
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Business value justification
- Dependencies identified

### Task Breakdown

Large stories are broken into:

- Development tasks
- Testing tasks
- Documentation tasks
- Design tasks

### Risk Assessment

Identify and mitigate:

- Technical dependencies
- External team coordination
- Learning curve for new technologies
- Resource constraints

## Sprint Execution

### Daily Standups

- 15-minute daily check-ins
- What was done yesterday
- What will be done today
- Any blockers or impediments

### Progress Tracking

- Daily burndown chart updates
- Story completion status
- Risk monitoring and mitigation

### Sprint Reviews

- Demonstrate completed work
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Discuss sprint outcomes
- Adjust backlog priorities

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well

- Celebrate successes
- Identify effective practices
- Share positive experiences

### What Could Be Improved

- Discuss challenges and blockers
- Identify process improvements
- Create action items for next sprint

### Action Items

- Assign owners and timelines
- Track implementation in next sprint
- Measure impact of changes

## Best Practices

### Planning Tips

- Keep sprint goals focused and achievable
- Maintain buffer for unexpected work
- Regularly refine backlog during sprint
- Use data-driven capacity planning

### Common Pitfalls

- Overcommitting to work
- Poor story definition
- Ignoring team capacity
- Skipping retrospectives

### Success Metrics

- Sprint goal achievement rate
- Story completion percentage
- Velocity stability
- Team satisfaction scores

## Tools and Templates

- Sprint planning checklist
- Capacity calculation spreadsheet
- Story point estimation guide
- Sprint retrospective template

Effective sprint planning ensures predictable delivery, team alignment, and continuous improvement.

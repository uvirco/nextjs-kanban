# Daily Standups

Daily standup meetings are the heartbeat of our agile process, providing rhythm and alignment for the development team.

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Daily Standups?
- **Synchronization**: Keep everyone aligned on progress
- **Early Detection**: Identify issues before they become blockers
- **Accountability**: Maintain commitment to sprint goals
- **Collaboration**: Foster team communication and support

### Key Benefits
- Reduced need for status meetings
- Faster problem resolution
- Improved team coordination
- Increased transparency

## Meeting Structure

### Time and Format
- **Duration**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Frequency**: Every weekday at the same time
- **Location**: Same virtual/physical location
- **Attendance**: Entire development team required

### Standup Questions

Each team member answers three questions:

#### 1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
- Focus on completed work
- Highlight achievements and progress
- Share learnings or discoveries

#### 2. What will I work on today?
- State specific tasks and goals
- Show commitment to sprint objectives
- Identify dependencies on others

#### 3. Are there any blockers or impediments?
- Be honest about obstacles
- Request help when needed
- Flag risks early

## Best Practices

### Keep It Brief
